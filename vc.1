.SH DESCRIPTION
The \fBvc\fP tool adds a new changes entry to a SUSE \fB.changes\fP file.
The \fB-m\fP option can be used to directly specify the entry, if it is
not given an editor is started to interactively enter the new changes
entry. If a \fIcommentfile\fP is given, its content is used as template
for the new entry instead of an empty entry, whereas the \fB-e\fP option
suppresses the creation of an empty entry.

If no \fIchangesfile\fP is specified, \fBvc\fP will search the current
directory for a file ending with \fB.changes\fP. If a directory is
specified instead of a changes will, it will be searched instead.
